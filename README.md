# Pong
Using reinforcement learning to teach agent to win at Pong

Currently in progress to recreating this project.

<h2> Process:</h2>

<p1><br> a) Read and Understand the code. </p1></br>
<p2><br> b) Recreate and rewrite what I understood from scratch. </p2></br>
<p3><br> c) Train the neural network, may take around 3 days or more based on the value set for the hyperparameters </p3></br>

<p4></br> V1 - All comments belong to me and reflect my understand, and I updated the 3 image processing functions into one.<p4></br>

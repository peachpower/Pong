# Pong
Using reinforcement learning to teach agent to win at Pong

Currently in progress to recreating this project.

<h2> Process:</h2>
  a) Read and Understand the code.
  b) Recreate and rewrite what I understood from scratch. 
  c) Train the neural network, may take around 3 days or more based on the value set for the hyperparameters
 V1 - All comments belong to me and reflect my understand, and I updated the 3 image processing functions into one.
